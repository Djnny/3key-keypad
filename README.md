# Overview
3key keypad for ring+index players

This document will act as a sort of design goals/challenges log until the project is complete.

# Design Goals
The main objective for this project is to design and build a working keypad that accomodates the ring+index playstyle in osu, as well as provide me with experience to shift to larger projects in the future.

Some of the features I would like to have in the final project include:
- practical pcb with kailh hotswap socket support
- working rgb underglow leds
- custom QMK firmware
- extra buttons for miscellaneous ingame functions
- OLED display support because why not
- stylish looking case
